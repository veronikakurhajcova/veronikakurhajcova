# 👋 Hi, I’m Veronika. I'm transitioning from Web Development to automated testing, and I'm passionate about ensuring software quality.
  
## ✅ Testing technologies I work with
     
| Technology                   | Description                                                             |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Selenium WebDriver**           | A tool I used to automate testing of web applications in my projects, ensuring functionality and usability met the specified requirements.       |
| **Java**                         | The programming language in which I developed automated tests and scripts for processing test data, allowing me to effectively test various scenarios.            |
| **TestNG**                       | A testing framework for Java that I utilized to organize and execute my tests, helping me maintain clarity and efficiency in the testing process.              |
| **JUnit**                        | A testing framework for Java that assisted me in writing and executing unit tests, enhancing the quality and reliability of my code.                |
| **XML**                          | A markup language I used for representing test data and configuring test scripts.                   |
| **SQL**                          | The language for database management that I employed to interact with databases during testing and to validate data accuracy.               |
| **Extent Reports**               | A reporting tool for test results that I used to create clear and visually appealing reports for my clients and colleagues.           |
| **Jenkins**                      | A continuous integration tool that I utilized to automate the deployment and testing of my applications, streamlining the development process.          |
| **Confluence**                   | A collaboration tool I used for documenting projects and sharing knowledge with the team.                               |
| **Jira**                         | An issue tracking and project management tool that I utilized for planning tests and tracking bugs within projects.          |
  
 🌱 I’m currently learning Cucumber and working on continuously improving and enhancing my previous skills
